# GabrielG-Neo.github.io

This is my second attempt at creating a portfolio for my future career in Web Development. In this web page you will find a section where I tell you a bit about myself, my background and my intentions in becoming part of the web development world.
I do find myself absorbing the information more as I spend more time actually coding and reviewing the information I have been taught along with using all the tools and resouces available to me.
Majority of this portfolio web page was created with the information I understand and also the information I need to dive deeper into.I am proud of what I have accomplished thus far, but am also eager and motivated to gain more understanding in the future.
What I would like any visitor to notice is the knowledge I have gained creating from scratch. I would also like to invite visitors back in the future to witness my new understandings of Flexbox, CSS, @media.
